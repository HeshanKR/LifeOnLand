                <p>Deforestation has significantly altered global landscapes, with 34% of Western Europe and 34% of North America's forests cut down for timber and agriculture.

                The largest deforestation is in tropical rainforests, aided by road construction and slash-and-burn agriculture. This leads to increased carbon dioxide emissions, threats to biodiversity, and soil erosion.
            
                While deforestation can be permanent, conservation efforts are allowing forests to return in some areas.</p> <!-- Paragraph explaining the global impact of deforestation -->

                <p>Forests, covering 30% of global land, provide essential resources like food, timber, energy, shelter, and medicine.

                However, they are threatened by deforestation, climate change, forest fires, and disease. While some forests have increased due to replanting, the loss of forests is expected to continue, necessitating effective forest management plans that balance environmental protection and human society's economic needs.</p> <!-- Paragraph explaining the distribution and threats to forests -->

                <p>Amazon and Indonesian fires are primarily manmade due to illegal deforestation and farmland clearing.

                Wildfires are rare in tropical rainforests due to high humidity. Large-scale clearing disrupts rainforest's water absorption, storage, and recycling processes, making it fire-prone.</p> <!-- Paragraph explaining burn deforestation -->
