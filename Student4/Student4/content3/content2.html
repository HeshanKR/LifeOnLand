                  <br>In ecosystems organisms interact with each other and different environments around them in diverse ways. Brainy species we humans have come a long way from living in cave to experiencing virtual reality. Human activities release a variety of gaseous waste products. People once thought vast atmosphere could absorb these materials indefinitely but now we know that's such addition can cause fundamental changes to the atmosphere and to its interactions with the rest of their biosphere.<br>

                        <br>Due to increased use of carbondioxide and greenhouse gases atmosphericozone(O3) has changed in concentartion.Life of Earth is protected from the damaging efffects of ultra (UV) radiation by layer of ozone located in the statosphere 17-25 km above Earth's surface.
                        However ,satelite studies of the atmosphere of the atmosphere shows that spring time ozone layer over Antartica has thinned substantilly since mid-1970s.If amount of radiation reaching ground increased sharply,causing more DNA damage in plants that were not protected by filters.Scientists have shown similar DNA damage and a reduction in phytoplanktons growth when ozone hole open over the Southern(Antartic Ocean) Ocean each year. <br>

                        <br>Since the industrial revolution the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has been increasing as a result of the burning fossil fuel. The marked increase in concentration of atmospheric CO2 over the last 150 years concerned scientists because it's linked to increased global temperature. Much of the solar radiation that's strike the planet is reflected back into space. Although CO2, methane, water vapor and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are transparent to visible light they intercept and absorb much of the infrared radiation. Earth emits re-reflecting some of it back to toward earth.
                        This process retain some of heat this contribute to global warming and scientists predict by the end of the 21st century global temperature will increase by about 3Â°C.<br>

                          <br>We will need many approaches to slow global warming. Quick progress can be made by using energy more efficiently and by replacing fuels with renewable solar and wind power and controversially with new nuclear power.
                          Another approach to slowing  global warming is to reduce deforestation around the world particularly in tropics. Reducing deforestation would not only slow up the buildup of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere but would also sustains native forest and preserve biodiversity ,a positive outcome for all this.<br>

                           <br>To sustain ecosystem process and the stem the loss of biodiversity we must connect life science with the social sciences economics and the humanities
                           . We must also reassess our personal values. We should learn to value natural processes that sustained us.
                            We evolved in a natural environment great in bio- diversity and we still have an affinity for such settings .
                            We respect life by using nature responsibly and reverently to improve human welfare.It is important to highlight we are able to solve and environmental problem when we set our minds to it .
                            We are most likely to protect what we appreciate and we are most likely to appreciate what we  
                            understand. So let us understand about earth more.<br>
