                <h2>The Importance of Biodiversity and Healthy Ecosystems</h2>
                <p>Variety does our planet survive on. For a whole range of living organisms such as the tallest redwoods in the world and very minute bacteria, biodiversity is the essence of healthy ecosystems. Rainforests, coral reefs, and wetlands are examples of such ecosystems which are made up of intricate networks of living entities linked to their surroundings. Just as a healthy digestive system requires a variety of microbes, so too does a thriving ecosystem require many different species.

                    The healthiness of our planet depends largely on its biodiversity. While numerous organisms recycle waste and filter water, plants together with algae produce the air we breathe. Various forests act as carbon sinks decreasing climate change. Bees and butterflies are some of the pollinators that foster reproduction in many plants including some which we consume for food. In short, biodiversity is at the center of how this planet serves us with life support systems while still making it function on its own.

                    But this intricate network of life is at great risk. Deforestation and urbanization reduce wildlife living space. Delicate ecological balances are disrupted by pollution from chemicals and waste, among others. Ecosystems are further interrupted by climate change, resulting from heating up of the earth’s surface and extreme weather conditions. These natural systems lose strength with a reduction in biodiversity, thereby threatening clean air, water as well as other resources we depend on for survival.</p>

                <h2 >What is Ecosystem Restoration?</h2>
                <p id="topic3-start">Fixing and revitalizing ruined ecosystems is the meaning of ecosystem restoration. The idea is to reinstate a natural equilibrium of species and ecological processes. Various approaches are employed depending on what it takes to restore the ecosystem concerned.

                    Some strategies may be carried out to rehabilitate habitat such as planting indigenous plants in areas that have been degraded and removing invasive species. Restocking native fish or mammals that have disappeared in an area can reintroduce lost ecological connections between them. Wildlife corridors, for instance, are secure land strips that facilitate movement of animals through patches of fragmented habitats.
                    
                    Consequently, we can put these heal wounds inflicted on our planet by using these restoration techniques.</p>

                    <p>Overgrown meadows in Yosemite National Park resulted from several decades’ absence of regular forest fires. Meadows have been restored by way of prescribed burns that imitate natural fires and reintroduction of indigenous plants.
